## 1.Visibility
This is the*** biggest advantage*** for gitkraken.Because it is a tool to use "git".It can help us use git without code and we just need to click button then we can finish our job.
#### Through the GUI we can easily know  the changes of our project and commit or pull our code.

## 2.Consistency

We can see that In this app there are only some simple color:blue,black,red,green.  
But we can use it easily Beacuse it has consistency.  
 ALL the operation that have no harm is green ,and all the master branch is thesame blue.ALL the color of other branch has the same color of  it's creater.  
 Last the programer love black right?I think it is also a consistency.


## 3.familiarity

The gitkraken has many small icon to show this button's function and most of them can be easily recognized by programer.Espacially the ***terminal*** ,if you are not familiar with GUI you can choose your familiar one.

## 4.Affordance

In Gitkraken ,if this operation can not be down,it will show a  ***"stop icon"*** to help us konw that you may meet some thing wrong.

## 5.Navigation

In the first image it shows a lot of list and navigator. It  can help us to search the usage of this application(if you are familiar with git).

And the tree of project I think is also a kind of Navigator. Althrough It is now created by Gitkraken. 



## 6.Control



If we are trying to pull new code the pull icon will turns into a circle to show that it is under control. 

And if it was failed it also shows error to show the result .

## 7.Feedback

For gitkraken it also has it's start page to show that it is opening.

and while you are cloning some project it will show the progress bar to show you that how long it will  takes.

## 8.Recovery

It provide ***undo button*** to recover your some wrong operations. But it is also limitted by the git itself . If you send the wrong code to server and you may never recover it.

## 9.Constraints

gitkraken turns the button into black to show programmer that you can not click this button.

and if some branch you can not checkout it will also turns into black

## 10.Flexibity

In the UI page we  can change it's theme and layout to fit our requirments.But  I think it is not so good ,beacuse It can only change color or change the position of  navigate bars.

## 11.Style

I think for this tool ,easy and eyes caring is very important . For programers , we may watch the screen over 20h a day, so some "beautiful" theme will kill our eyes.

## 12.Conviviality

I think gitkraken do  a good job in conviviality. Because it has cute octopus.

with these octopus I can find it easily and use it for my head portrait and when we are building our project we can use  these octopus to show your push and we can find bug more easily.
