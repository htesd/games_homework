## Layout

​	This layout is redesigned for the Applet interface in Wechat. The first interface is a ***Drawer*** to ***manage a large number of applet*** . And the ***Store*** can help users to ***discover more applet like other App store*** . And the two page can ***switch*** easily by  drawing button.

## Element

This button is used for ***linking the Applet Drawer and Applet Store*** . Users just need to drag the button from left to right, then user can goto the store to find more applet. The position is specially designed. Because In the drawer user need to use list to manage applets. So I put it in the left of drawer.

## Improvements

1. Applets is getting more and more(I have more than 50 applets). I use the ***drawer*** to solve this problem.  (Dropping down conversation list to show the applets  *** is like opening a drawer!***) So I add the Categories and a List of initials to manage a large number of applets.

   so according to the design principle I have:

   1.Visibility

   2.Navigation

   3.Flexibity

   4.Conviviality

   <center>cluttered list hard to find applet!</center>

2. Bind the store to the drawer for  user access it easily. ***Fit PACT framework***
